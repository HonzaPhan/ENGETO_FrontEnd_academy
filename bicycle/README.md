<h1> One-page e-shop bicycle </h1>
<p> In this project I created simple one-page website containing bicycle from e-shop.</p> 
<p> The assignment is to create one-page website using knowledge and skills, what I have learned from the first lesson up to now. </p>
<p> I use simply HTML, CSS and added JavaScript button to redirect to another page. </p>
<p> For code editor I chose <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> with extension "Live Server" to see my code live in time. </p>
<p> Template should look like this: </p>
